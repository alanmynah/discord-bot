# Planning reputation system
- Need to subscribe to all **public** emoji reactions
- Or it could be a command but the command thing is less
  intuitive - how will people know what to write?
- How will people know what emoji to react with?
- What emoji should they react with even lol? Maybe the
  purple heart
- If someone is the _recipient_ of a heart, they get one
  point
- Instead of storing a counter, I must create a database
  record for each vote
- Also, if someone removes a heart, you could lose a point
  (DELETE)
- When someone gives or gets reputation, it could be
  broadcasted to a channel - now people can see what is
  happening and it's not possible to miss
